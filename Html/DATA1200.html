            <h2>Levanger</h2>

            <p class="edit2"> Levanger is a beautiful city with its roots in the 
            past. Celebrating its 1000th year in 2011, 
            Levanger is an important port city between the 
            Norwegian Sweden, which has been economically 
            and politically active since the 19th century.It has 
            a rich and diverse nature stretching from the fjord 
            to the high mountain. 
            In the plains, there are cultural landscapes that 
            are very important for many species, and in the 
            eastern parts there are large marsh areas and 
            mountains. 
            Levanger has an unspoiled nature with its rich 
            animal and plant life. It also has beautiful 
            landscapes such as a small boat marina and a 
            city park. Since the past, the fjord has been the 
            main transportation route for passenger traffic and 
            agricultural products are transported. Also, a rare 
            and unspoilt swamp like The Øvre Forra is found 
            in just a few places in Norway.</p> 
                <h2>River Promenade</h2> 
                <p class="edit2">Levanger River passes through the Levanger elegantly. 
            There is a nice walking and cycling path with seating 
            areas all along the river</p>
                <h2>Bicycle</h2>
                <p class="edit2">Levanger has a large network for cycling around the city. 
            From Torget to Røstad, via Holmgården, you can stop by 
            crossing the harbor on the Snakkarberget bridge and you 
            can visit the Levanger amusement park and Magneten 
            shopping center</p>
                <h2>Brusve Manor</h2>
                <p class="edit2">It was a mansion dating back to 1803 and has been 
            restored. The museum also has the residence of the 
            Reinslyst Laborer built in 1850 inside it. It includes old 
            crafts, a modern art gallery and a local photographer's 
            photo collection.</p>
