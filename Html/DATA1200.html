            past. Celebrating its 1000th year in 2011, 
            Levanger is an important port city between the 
            Norwegian Sweden, which has been economically 
            and politically active since the 19th century.It has 
            a rich and diverse nature stretching from the fjord 
            to the high mountain. 
            In the plains, there are cultural landscapes that 
            are very important for many species, and in the 
            eastern parts there are large marsh areas and 
            mountains. 
            Levanger has an unspoiled nature with its rich

            agricultural products are transported. Also, a rare 
            and unspoilt swamp like The Øvre Forra is found 
            in just a few places in Norway.</p>
